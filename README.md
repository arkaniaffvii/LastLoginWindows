# LastLoginWindows
LastLoginWindows is a lightweight utility that runs automatically upon user login on a Windows system and displays the date and time of the previous successful login for the current user account.

This utility is supported on Windows 10/11 Pro by default.  
On Windows 10/11 Home editions, additional configuration steps are required to enable the Windows Security Event with ID 4801, which is necessary to track the last time the user account was unlocked.
